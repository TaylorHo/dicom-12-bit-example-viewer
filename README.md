# Example DICOM Viewer

This is an example DICOM Viewer, extracted from the Cornerstone3D examples list .

The intent here is to have a ready to use and as-simple-as-possible DICOM viewer, so we can change things quickly.

The `src/htmlSetup.js` initialize the HTML structure of the page. Probably you don't want to change this file.

The `src/index.js` file is where Cornerstone3D logic is implemented. This is probably where you want to make changes.

The other files are Cornerstone3D helpers. Avoid editing them.
